## Challenge

Look mum I can fly!

## Attachments

A video of a plane taking off from an airport. (not attached)

## Solution

Using some GeoOSINT tools, we can find the location of the airport easily.
Passing some frames of the video through Google Image Search, we can find the airport.

We then search for the IATA and ICAO codes of the airport, and we find the flag.
